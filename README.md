# FAC-Application-Project [Website]

## ðŸ’¡ Plan & Reference

I aim to create an engaging and playful website with a bright and lively design. <br>
I was inspired by a dashboard design with a stylish curved side menu.<br>
I started by sketching out the layout by hand, putting in a lot of care to make it both professional and visually appealing.

## ðŸš€ Feature 
The website has three sections that provide information about me, my motivation for becoming a web developer, and a showcase of my projects.<br>
All pages are built using vanilla JavaScript for a fun and interactive experience.

##### âœ… Home 
The home page serves as an introduction. Once the page loads, my emoji and paragraph will appear.
Clicking the side menu will take you to the other sections and add a new style class.


##### âœ… About me
I drew inspiration from messaging interface. A chatbot will ask questions about me and my career, and I'll answer them. <br>
Using vanilla JavaScript, I've added a setTimeout function so that the chat bubbles appear one by one.

##### âœ… Project
The project images are stored in folders. Hovering over the folder images will reveal the hidden images.<br>
Clicking on the images will allow you to view the actual website.
