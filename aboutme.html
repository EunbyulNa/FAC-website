          <p>Intersting! Can you tell me about your coding journey?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answerTwo">
          <p>My coding journey started when I was 10 or 11 years old,
            changing the font color for my personal webpage. But i was not taking seriolusy do programming.
            I totally ignored my desire of creation for so long.</p>

        <div class="answerThree">
          <p>In 2019, I was working as a sales assistant and wanted to change my career path,
            but I didnâ€™t have any idea where I should start. And my roommate told me about Founders and coders,
            web developer jobs etc. That reminds me when I changed my font-color for the first time with a code!
            After that I started studying web development on my own using freecodecamp, codewar, Udemy, and other resources.</p>
         <img src="img/chatme.png" alt="">
      </div>

        <div class="answerFour">
         <p>I enjoyed building things from scratch and wanted to attend the Founders and Coders bootcamp.
           However, my visa would expire soon, so I had to back to Korea.
           I did a government funding front-end bootcamp for 6 months in there.
           So I could learn HTML, CSS, jQuery, Photoshop. With those skills, I made a business website for my mother in law</p>

          <p>Why do you want to move into a career as a web developer?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="answerFive">
         <p>I enjoy the process of building something and turning my imagination into reality.
           I find programming is  a creative process that involves logical thinking, which I love to do.</p>

        <div class="answerSix">
          <p>I was fascinated when I made a business website for my mother-in-law.
            I enjoyed communicating with my client and seeing the end-user interact with my creation.
            This experience sparked my interest in web development and solidified my desire to pursue a career in this field.</p>

          <p> Why do you want to join the Founders and coders bootcamp?</p>
        </div>


        <div class="answerSeven">
          <p>Founders and coders offers a unique experience. The challenges to join the bootcamp will make me stronger and more confident.
            And I like the code community-based approach, rather than a teacher-student base.
            It will allow me to share ideas and help others.</p>

        <div class="answerEight">
          <p>Especially, I really want to joining The apprenticeship program.
            Itâ€™s hard to get the first job as a junior developer in real word.
            But offering appernticehip is a good chane to gain valuable working experience, also fill out the back-end part!
            I am excited to work as a apprenticeship</p>
