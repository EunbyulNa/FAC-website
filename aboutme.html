           <p>My name is Eunbyul Na. I was born and grew up in South Korea. I used to work as a radiographer for 5years.
             I wanted to challenge myself to live abroad, so I moved to the UK in 2018. A year later I met my husband in London. Again a year later we got married. </p>

            <p>My coding journey started when I was 10 or 11 years old,
              changing the font color for my personal webpage. But i was not taking seriolusy do programming.
              I totally ignored my desire of creation for so long.</p>

            <p>In 2019, I was working as a sales assistant and wanted to change my career path,
              but I didnâ€™t have any idea where I should start. And my roommate told me about Founders and coders,
              web developer jobs etc. <br>That reminds me when I changed my font-color for the first time with a code!
              After that I started studying web development on my own using freecodecamp, codewar, Udemy, and other resources.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed building things from scratch and wanted to attend the Founders and Coders bootcamp.
              However, my visa would expire soon, so I had to back to Korea.
              I did a government funding front-end bootcamp for 6 months in there.
              <br>So I could learn HTML, CSS, jQuery, Photoshop. With those skills, I made a business website for my mother in law</p>

            <p>Founders and coders offers a unique experience. The challenges to join the bootcamp will make me stronger and more confident.
              And I like the code community-based approach, rather than a teacher-student base.
              It will allow me to share ideas and help others.</p>

            <p>Especially, I am eager to join the apprenticeship program.
              Itâ€™s hard to get the first job as a junior developer in real word.
              but the apprenticeship offers a great opportunity to gain valuable work experience and strengthen my skills in the back-end.
               I am excited to work as an apprentice.</p>
